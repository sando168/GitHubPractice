This is my first git file!

At this point I will be staging files:
- StagingFile1.txt
- StagingFile2.txt
- README.md
And committing them to my repository

Apparently the -a cmd line option will allow
me to automatically stage every file that
gets changed in my local repo. I will be testing
this now.

In order to un-stage files I don't want to commit
I will use "git restore --staged <file>" and then
stage again using the -a option so I can commit 
this message.
