This is my first git file!

At this point I will be staging files:
- StagingFile1.txt
- StagingFile2.txt
- README.md
And committing them to my repository

Apparently the -a cmd line option will allow
me to automatically stage every file that
gets changed in my local repo. I will be testing
this now.

In order to un-stage files I don't want to commit
I will use "git restore --staged <file>" and then
stage again using the -a option so I can commit 
this message.

Created new branch to practice merging. The branching 
comment from Branching-Practice should soon be 
added to this file too.

Merge Conflict file was added to create a merge 
conflict before merging Branching-Practice branch to 
master branch.

This is an edit to help me practice branching.
How to create a branch:
git branch <name>
How to move to created branch:
git checkout <branch-name>

Adding this comment to commit a change to this 
GitHub repo and use the pull command to update my 
local copy of the repository.

Making another pull commit.
